# Class 8 - Testing Utilities

This folder contains test configurations and implementations for React components.

## Running Tests

### Vitest Unit Tests

To run the unit tests for components like `LoginPage` and `TravelForm`, execute the following command:

```bash
npx vitest --run
```

### Cypress End-to-End Tests

To run the end-to-end tests that verify user interface functionality, execute:

```bash
npx cypress open
```

This will open the Cypress Test Runner, allowing you to select and run tests interactively.
